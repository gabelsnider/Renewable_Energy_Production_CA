# Renewable Energy Production in California (2019-2021)

An interactive Shiny dashboard exploring the relationship between 
renewable energy generation, electricity demand, and the climate 
variables that drive both.

## Overview

California leads the nation in renewable energy capacity, yet renewables 
cover less than 25% of total electricity demand the vast majority of the 
time. This dashboard investigates why — examining seasonal patterns, 
temperature sensitivity, and grid volatility using 5-minute interval 
data from 2019 to 2021.
